# SProxyüåêüîÄ

## Description

A simple Reverse Proxy implementation in Golang which proxies a http client's requests via a residential proxy
in a preferred location, whilst maintaining a proxy session for the duration of the session.

Proxy location is determined intelligently by parsing custom headers from the client or a config file.
It handles multiple concurrent sessions effortlessly and is very responsive.

Example use-case: For a Web Scraper/Crawler for bypassing geoblocks, rate-limits etc.
